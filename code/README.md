## Code

[***conv.pl***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/conv.pl) is a Perl script that will read a Scott Adams game file and convert it to BeebScott format. The input file can be either a TRS-80 .DAT file (a.k.a. a "[ScottFree format](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/scott-adams/games/scottfree/)" file) or a compiled [ScottKit](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/scottkit) .sao file. (The output from *conv.pl* is actually a BBC BASIC program in plain text. That BBC BASIC program, when run on a BBC Micro computer (or emulator) with 65(C)02 co-processor, will write the converted data, in BeebScott format, to a BBC Micro filesystem: in practice you will probably want to use an emulator to run the BBC BASIC program and write the data to the floppy-disc image *template.ssd*.)

[***terp.bas***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/terp.bas) is a Scott Adams game interpreter program, written in BBC BASIC. Before being run, *terp.bas* must be compressed ("packed") with [basictool](https://github.com/ZornsLemma/basictool). When run, *terp.bas* will read in a game data file (which has been converted to BeebScott format by *conv.pl*) and enable the user to play the game on a BBC Micro computer or emulator. 

[***load.bas***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/load.bas) is the loader program, written in BBC BASIC. It displays the generic intro text, adapted from Scott Adams's own TRS-80 interpreter(s); it then sets up a custom newline routine in machine code if the game data contains manual newlines; and finally it runs *terp.bas*. 

[***template.ssd***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/blob/main/code/template.ssd) is a bootable floppy-disc image in Acorn DFS format. The file *terp.bas* (after being packed with [basictool](https://github.com/ZornsLemma/basictool) and renamed to $.TERP) and the file *load.bas* (after being tokenized with basictool and renamed to $.LOAD) should be added to *template.ssd* â€” this can be done with the help of [Disc Image Manager](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=299825#p299825) or [sweh's MMB/SSD Perl utilities](https://sweh.spuddy.org/Beeb/mmb_utils.html). The game data file $.DAT (the output of the BASIC program generated by *conv.pl*) should also be added to *template.ssd*.

You can now [play some games](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/games) (or [run some tests](http://bbcmicro.co.uk//jsbeeb/play.php?autoboot&disc=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahope1/BeebScott/master/test/cases.ssd)) in BeebScott.
