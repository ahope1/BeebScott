## Code

[***conv.pl***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/conv.pl) **is a Perl script that will read a Scott Adams game file and convert it to BeebScott format.** The input file can be either a TRS-80 .DAT file (a.k.a. a "[ScottFree format](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/scott-adams/games/scottfree/)" file) or a compiled [ScottKit](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/scottkit) .sao file. The output from *conv.pl* is a file named DAT, which should be added to the BBC Micro disc-image *template.ssd* (below).

[***terp.bas***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/terp.bas) **is a Scott Adams game interpreter program, written in BBC BASIC.** Before being run, *terp.bas* must be compressed ("packed") with [basictool](https://github.com/ZornsLemma/basictool) and renamed to TERP. When run on a BBC Micro computer (or emulator), TERP will read in a game data file (which has been converted to BeebScott format by *conv.pl*) and enable the user to play the game. 

[***load.bas***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/load.bas) **is the loader program, written in BBC BASIC.** It displays the generic intro text, adapted from Scott Adams's own TRS-80 interpreter(s); it then sets up a custom newline routine in machine code if the game data contains manual newlines; and finally it runs *terp.bas*. 

[***template.ssd***](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/blob/main/code/template.ssd) **is a bootable floppy disc image in Acorn DFS format.** You should compress the file *terp.bas* with [basictool](https://github.com/ZornsLemma/basictool), rename it to TERP, and then add it to *template.ssd*. Also, you should  tokenize the file *load.bas* with basictool, rename it to LOAD, and then add it to *template.ssd*. The game data file DAT (the output of the *conv.pl* script) should also be added to *template.ssd*. (You can add files to *template.ssd* with the help of [Disc Image Manager](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=299825#p299825) or [sweh's MMB/SSD Perl utilities](https://sweh.spuddy.org/Beeb/mmb_utils.html).) 

You can now [play some games](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/games) (or [run some tests](http://bbcmicro.co.uk//jsbeeb/play.php?autoboot&disc=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahope1/BeebScott/master/test/cases.ssd)) in BeebScott.
