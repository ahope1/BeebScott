Secret Mission was originally created by Scott Adams and [published](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scott_Adams_Adventure_video_games) by Adventure International in 1979.

This version of Secret Mission derives from the "ScottFree" .DAT-format version of the game which is available [from the IF Archive](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/scott-adams/games/scottfree/). (A similar collection of .DAT files is available [from Scott Adams's website](https://www.msadams.com/downloads.htm).) The .DAT file was converted for use with BeebScott by the [*conv.pl*](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/) script, via ScottKit. (ScottKit was used to remove a small amount of redundant code from the game before conversion with *conv.pl*.)

A solution or walkthrough is available [from CASA](http://www.solutionarchive.com/game/id%2C472/Secret+Mission.html).
