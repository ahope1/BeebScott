# Buckaroo Banzai

A copy of the text adventure game Buckaroo Banzai converted for use with BeebScott. Buckaroo Banzai was created by Scott Adams and Phillip Case and [published](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Buckaroo_Banzai_Across_the_8th_Dimension#Video_games) by Adventure International in 1984.

This version of Buckaroo Banzai derives from the "ScottFree" .DAT-format version of the game which is available [from the IF Archive](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/scott-adams/games/scottfree/). (A similar collection of .DAT files is available [from Scott Adams's website](https://www.msadams.com/downloads.htm) but Buckaroo is missing.) The .DAT was converted for use with BeebScott using the [*conv.pl*](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/conv.pl) script, via ScottKit. ScottKit was used to debug the game before conversion with *conv.pl*: the [bug(s)](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/scottkit#bug-tolerance) seem to have been present in the original release(s) of the game. 

A solution or walkthrough is available [from CASA](http://www.solutionarchive.com/game/id%2C60/Adventures+of+Buckaroo+Banzai%2C+The.html).
