Ghost King was written by Jason Compton using ScottKit and [released](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=pv6hkqi34nzn1tdy) in 2020.

A manually newlined version of a ScottKit-compiled .sao file ([*gkiOVERLONG.sao*](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/blob/main/games/GhostKing/gkiOVERLONG.sao)), containing the logic and the data for the game, was converted for use with BeebScott by the [*conv.pl*](https://github.com/ahope1/BeebScott/tree/main/code/conv.pl) script.
